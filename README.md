# Cocktail Finder App
A create-react-app that searches the CocktailDB API for cocktail recipes.
- Searching can be done by cocktail name or ingredient
- Darkmode
- Summer Drinks page for inspiration

I created this app for whenever I might need to look up a cocktail to see what it's made with or when I need a recipe. I wanted a dark mode to make the app more versatile for when the user might want to make cocktails in a darker environment.

## Live site
- Site deployed with Netlify at: https://my-cocktail-finder.netlify.app/

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- React
- Tailwind CSS


## My process
I started by setting up a basic search using the API and using react router to inspect cocktails individually. Then I added a separate page for summer drinks.
I added a modal for looking at the ingredients afterwards and then the darkmode.

## What I learned
I learned how to work with multiple API calls and reinforced my knowledge of react router and context. This is also my first project with Tailwind.
